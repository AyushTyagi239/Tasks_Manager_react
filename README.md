🚀 Just built a React Task Manager Demo App!
This simple yet functional app allows users to:

✅ Add new projects with a title, description, and due date
✅ View selected project details dynamically
✅ Add and delete individual tasks within each project
✅ See real-time UI updates using useState, useRef, and conditional rendering
✅ Get instant feedback using a custom modal popup for invalid inputs

This project helped me solidify my React fundamentals including component-based architecture, props management, and user interaction flows.

📘 Currently learning from:
🎓 The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More on Udemy — and applying concepts in real-world UI examples.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

💡 Always open to feedback, collaboration, or suggestions!
